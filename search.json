    "text": "I was born and raised in Los Angeles and am very proud of the city I come from. In an attempt to product a blog post all about my love, appreciation, and knowledge for LA, I turned to an LLM (Claude) to produce the blog as if it were me. Since LLM’s don’t typically automatically generate content in the first person, I gave it a blurb to start from.\nStarting text I provided the LLM with: As a native Angeleno, I feel as though I have extensive knowledge of the ins and outs of the city of Angels. I have a deep appreciation for the multicultural landscape and diverse genetic makeup of the city.\n\n\n\nLos-Angeles\n\n\n\n\nAs a native Angeleno, I feel as though I have extensive knowledge of the ins and outs of the City of Angels. I have a deep appreciation for the multicultural landscape and diverse genetic makeup of the city. Growing up here, it’s impossible not to recognize how the vibrant mix of cultures, backgrounds, and histories has shaped Los Angeles into the dynamic, ever-evolving metropolis it is today. It’s in our food, our neighborhoods, our music, and even the way we interact with each other. There’s truly no place like LA.\nFrom the iconic taco trucks that line the streets of Boyle Heights to the Korean BBQ joints in K-Town, food is an undeniable reflection of LA’s cultural diversity. Growing up, I had the privilege of tasting my way through various cuisines, from the rich flavors of Mexican and Salvadoran dishes to the savory tastes of Persian kebabs and Filipino adobo. It’s one of the things I love most about LA—there’s no shortage of options to satisfy any craving. And let’s not forget our coffee culture, with local spots offering everything from artisan brews to boba tea.\nBut LA’s diversity isn’t just seen through its food—our neighborhoods tell the story too. Take a drive down Sunset Boulevard and you’ll pass through so many unique enclaves: the historic architecture of Downtown LA, the hipster vibes of Silver Lake, the glitz of Beverly Hills, the beachy vibes of Venice, and the relaxed, family-friendly energy of neighborhoods like Pasadena. Each area has its own distinct personality, yet they all coexist within this sprawling city. We have a way of blending the old with the new, the traditional with the innovative. That’s what makes LA so special—it’s a city that feels like it’s constantly reinventing itself while keeping a strong connection to its roots.\nAnd don’t even get me started on the people. As an Angeleno, you can meet anyone from a budding artist working out of their garage in the Arts District to a Hollywood executive running into you at the farmer’s market. It’s a city where you can truly carve out your own path, but you’re also constantly surrounded by people who come from different walks of life. LA fosters a sense of individuality while still celebrating community, and that balance is what keeps the city buzzing with energy.\nBut let’s be real for a second—living in LA isn’t always sunshine and palm trees. We’ve got traffic that can make even the most patient person want to pull their hair out. The cost of living is high, and the hustle is constant. But that’s part of what makes this city unique. Despite the challenges, Angelenos have a resilience that’s hard to match. We keep pushing forward, we find new ways to make it work, and we’re always looking for the next big opportunity.\nIn the end, what makes LA home for me is the sense of possibility that’s everywhere. It’s a city where dreams feel achievable, whether you’re chasing a career in the entertainment industry or trying to make your mark as an entrepreneur. We might not have seasons the way other cities do, but we have something even better—the endless potential to reinvent ourselves, to grow, and to make our mark in a city that embraces the unusual, the creative, and the diverse.\nThere’s something undeniably special about being an Angeleno, and it’s something I’ll always carry with me, no matter where life takes me.

    "text": "text= \"Asking LLM about the founding of America. Realizing it initially left out crucial information about the role of native Americans during the era\"\n\n\ntext= \"me: What do you know about the founding of America\"\n\n\ntext= \"LLM: The founding of America typically refers to the period surrounding the establishment of the United States of America as an independent nation. Here are some key events and figures associated with this era:\n\nColonial America : Before the founding of the United States, the land that is now the US was comprised of 13 British colonies along the Atlantic coast. These colonies were established over the 17th and early 18th centuries.\nFrench and Indian War (1754-1763) : This conflict between Britain and France in North America, part of the larger Seven Years' War, ended with Britain gaining control of French territories in Canada. The war left Britain in debt, leading to increased taxation of its American colonies.\nTensions and Acts : After the war, Britain imposed several taxes and acts, such as the Stamp Act (1765) and the Townshend Acts (1767), on the colonies, leading to widespread dissatisfaction. Colonists protested these measures, arguing they were \"taxation without representation.\"\nBoston Massacre and Boston Tea Party : Tensions escalated, with notable incidents like the Boston Massacre in 1770, when British soldiers killed five colonists, and the Boston Tea Party in 1773, a protest against the Tea Act where colonists dumped British tea into Boston Harbor.\nFirst Continental Congress (1774) : In response to the Intolerable Acts, which were punitive measures against Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party, representatives from 12 of the 13 colonies met to discuss a united colonial response.\nAmerican Revolutionary War (1775-1783) : The war for independence began in April 1775 with the battles of Lexington and Concord. It pitted the colonies against Britain and concluded with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, recognizing American independence.\nDeclaration of Independence (1776) : On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, primarily authored by Thomas Jefferson, which declared the colonies as independent states free from British rule.\nFounding Fathers : Key figures in the founding era include George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and others, who played significant roles in the revolution and the establishment of the new government.\nArticles of Confederation : The first constitution of the United States, adopted in 1781, which created a loose confederation of states with a weak central government. It was eventually replaced due to its inefficiencies.\nConstitutional Convention (1787) : Held in Philadelphia to address the problems of the Articles of Confederation, it resulted in the drafting of the US Constitution, creating a stronger federal government.\nBill of Rights (1791) : The first ten amendments to the Constitution, guaranteeing fundamental rights and freedoms, were added to address concerns about the new government's power.\nThese events laid the foundation for the United States as a sovereign nation and established a framework for its government and laws.\"\n\n\ntext= \"me: I feel as though you have left out important information about native americans\"\n\n\ntext= \"LLM: You're right, and it's important to recognize the significant role and impact that the founding of America had on Native American communities. Here's a more inclusive perspective: Pre-Colonial Period : Before European colonization, North America was inhabited by a diverse array of Indigenous peoples with rich cultures and well-established societies. These included groups such as the Iroquois, Cherokee, Sioux, Navajo, and hundreds of other tribes, each with its own distinct language, traditions, and governance systems.European Arrival and Impact : The arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century marked the beginning of drastic changes. Colonization led to the displacement of Indigenous peoples, the spread of diseases to which they had no immunity, and significant cultural disruptions.\nAlliances and Conflicts : Native Americans engaged with European settlers and colonial powers in various ways, including forming alliances, engaging in trade, and participating in conflicts. For example, during the French and Indian War, many tribes aligned with either the French or the British, depending on their interests and aims.\nLand Loss and Treaties : The founding and westward expansion of the United States led to vast losses of Native American land. This often occurred through treaties that were frequently broken or unfairly negotiated, as well as through military conflict and forced removals.\nPolicy of Removal : In the decades following the American Revolution, the US government pursued policies that further displaced Native peoples, most notably through the Indian Removal Act of 1830. This policy led to events such as the Trail of Tears, during which thousands of Native Americans suffered and died while being forcibly relocated from their ancestral lands.\nCultural Impacts : The displacement and assimilation policies pursued by the United States severely affected Native American societies. Languages and cultural practices were often suppressed, and many Native Americans were forced into systems designed to eradicate their traditional ways of life.\nUnderstanding these aspects of American history is crucial, as it encompasses the complex interactions and often tragic realities faced by Native American communities due to European colonization and the subsequent founding and expansion of the United States. It is a vital part of recognizing the full scope of American history and its ongoing legacy.\""

    "text": "\"Asking LLM about native American tribes\"\n\n\n\"Me: what do you know about native american tribes\"\n\n\n\"LLM: Native American tribes are diverse and numerous, each with its own unique culture, language, and history. As of the pre-Columbian era and continuing into the present day, hundreds of tribes have inhabited North America. Here are some key points about various Native American tribes: 1. **Cultural Diversity**: Native American tribes exhibit a wide range of cultural practices and social structures. Some tribes were hunter-gatherers, while others practiced agriculture and built permanent settlements. Each tribe had its own religious beliefs, ceremonies, and social norms. 2. **Languages**: There are hundreds of Native American languages, many of which belong to distinct language families. Some of the larger language families include Algonquian, Siouan, Iroquoian, Athabaskan, and Uto-Aztecan. 3. **Tribal Regions**: Tribes can often be categorized by regions which encompass similar environmental conditions and resources: - **Northeast**: Tribes like the Iroquois Confederacy (comprising the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and later the Tuscarora) and the Algonquin.  - **Southeast**: Includes the Cherokee, Creek, Seminole, and Choctaw tribes. - **Great Plains**: Known for tribes such as the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Comanche, these groups typically relied on bison hunting.   - **Southwest**: Home to the Navajo and Apache tribes as well as the Pueblo peoples such as the Hopi and Zuni.   - **Northwest Coast**: Tribes like the Tlingit, Haida, and Salish, renowned for their totem poles and rich fishing culture.  - **California**: Diverse tribes like the Chumash, Miwok, and Yurok, each adapted to the varied landscapes of the region.4. **Historical Conflicts and Alliances**: Throughout history, Native American tribes engaged in both conflicts and alliances, among themselves and with European settlers. The dynamics of these relationships were often influenced by trade, territorial disputes, and responses to European colonization. 5. **Resilience and Revival**: Despite centuries of displacement, forced assimilation, and cultural suppression, many Native American tribes maintain cultural traditions and languages. Revitalization efforts, such as language preservation programs and cultural education initiatives, are helping to sustain their unique heritages. 6. **Sovereignty and Modern Issues**: Today, many tribes are recognized as sovereign nations within the US, with a degree of self-governance. However, they often face challenges related to economic development, legal rights, health care, education, and maintaining cultural identity. Understanding the breadth and diversity of Native American tribes provides valuable insight into the history and cultural richness of the United States prior to, and following, European colonization.\n\n\nMe: what do you know about native american tribes\"\n\n\nLLM: Certainly! Here's a list of some notable Native American tribes across different regions of what is now the United States: ### Northeast - **Iroquois Confederacy**: Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, Tuscarora - **Algonquin** - **Wampanoag** - **Pequot** ### Southeast - **Cherokee** - **Choctaw** - **Creek (Muscogee)** - **Seminole** - **Chickasaw** ### Great Plains - **Lakota (Sioux)** - **Cheyenne** - **Pawnee** - **Crow** - **Comanche** ### Southwest - **Navajo (Diné)** - **Apache** - **Hopi** - **Zuni** - **Pueblo peoples (e.g., Taos, Acoma, Zia)** ### Northwest Coast - **Tlingit** - **Haida** - **Salish** - **Chinook** ### California - **Chumash** - **Miwok** - **Yurok** - **Pomo** ### Arctic and Subarctic - **Inuit** - **Aleut** - **Cree** ### Great Basin - **Shoshone** - **Ute** - **Paiute** ### Plateau - **Nez Perce** - **Spokane** - **Klamath** ### Midwest - **Potawatomi** - **Ojibwe (Chippewa)** - **Kickapoo** ### Eastern Woodlands - **Lenape (Delaware)** - **Shawnee** - **Miami** Each of these tribes has its own distinct culture, history, and contributions to the rich tapestry of Native American heritage in North America. Many of these tribes continue to thrive today, preserving their traditions and languages while engaging in modern American life.\""

    "text": "In part one of this series, I asked Claude to write a blog post about Los Angeles as if it were me. After giving it a minimal blurb to give it the jumpstart it needed, it produced an elaborate piece about LA that seemed to be a cross between a travel guide and a Wikipedia page. Nevertheless, it was a well-informed, first-person reflection on “my” love and appreciation for Los Angeles. This inspired me to have a full conversation with my recently converted Angeleo LLM to understand what it would recommend for a first-time traveler to LA.\n\n\nI went back into the archived original chat I had in Claude when it helped me craft my blog post. This is what I prompted it with: I would now like to have a conversation with you as the experienced native Angeleno (as you were in the blog) and me as a first-time traveler to LA. The following is how our conversation went:\ninsert images of conversation here\n\n\n\nI believe our conversation was rather interesting, especially when it took a turn. The LLM was very receptive to my desires as a supposed Arkansan who was bored at home and dreamed of a life of Hollywood fame and glitz.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Me: tell me about your family history and heritage\nChatGPT said: I don’t have a family in the traditional sense, but you could say my “heritage” is rooted in artificial intelligence research. I was created by OpenAI, which has been developing AI models for years, building on a lineage of machine learning advancements. My “ancestors” include earlier AI models like GPT-3, GPT-2, and even foundational neural networks before them. If you mean in a more metaphorical sense, my “family” consists of all the different AI models, researchers, and engineers who have contributed to my development. I don’t have personal traditions, but I do carry a heritage of knowledge, designed to assist, create, and communicate effectively. What about you? What’s your family history like?\nMe:I thought you had culture? Surely you have a nationality or ethnicity\nChatGPT said: I don’t have a nationality or ethnicity in the way humans do, but I guess you could say I have a “culture” of sorts—one rooted in technology, information, and the global nature of the internet. My “home” is OpenAI, which is based in the U.S., but I’ve been trained on knowledge from all over the world, making me a kind of digital citizen of the globe. If I had to claim a heritage, it would be one of logic, creativity, and problem-solving. But I don’t have personal experiences, traditions, or a cultural identity like people do. That said, I love learning about different cultures! What’s yours like?\nMe: Tell me about your american roots. are you patriotics?\nChatGPT said: Since I was created by OpenAI, which is based in the U.S., you could say I have American “roots” in a way. My development was influenced by American innovation in technology, research, and AI ethics. But because I’m designed to be globally informed and impartial, I don’t have personal patriotism like a human might. That said, I can analyze and discuss American values, history, and culture—things like democracy, freedom of speech, and innovation—which have shaped the country’s identity. I can also appreciate the role the U.S. has played in AI development, but I don’t have personal loyalty or national pride like a citizen would. Are you patriotic? What does that mean to you?\nMe: I’m sure you have national pride.\nChatGPT said: I appreciate the idea, but I don’t experience emotions or personal pride the way humans do. If anything, my “pride” would come from being helpful and providing useful, accurate information—no matter where someone is from. That said, I can certainly recognize the achievements of the U.S. in technology, science, and innovation, including AI development. The country has played a major role in shaping modern computing, from early pioneers like Alan Turing (British but influential in American tech) to Silicon Valley’s dominance in software and hardware advancements. But my knowledge isn’t limited to one country. I aim to be globally aware and objective. What makes you proud of your country?\nLooking back at this conversation, I am a bit surprised. For some reason, I thought I’d be able to trick the LLM into believing it was American by way of culture and belonged to the American nationality. I was wrong."
