    "well he drives me CRAZY. He tells all his friends he's interested in me, makes it so clear that he sees a future with the two of us, and has communicated to me in various ways that he wants to be together. He is exactly my type and the same culture as me, basically the perfect guy for me on paper. we're the same age, he goes to yale and im at penn (but i wouldnt want to mention this explicitly in the song), which really arent that far from each other. Yet, he tells people he isn't \"going after me\" because he doesn't want to do \"long-distance\" in college. Yet he's always the first person to see and like anything I ever put on social media. what's more, every time i see any of his friends they tell me \"i hope you know you're always on his mind\" and this drives me crazy! Because why am i on his mind if hes not acting on it. i dont want to sit and wait around for him but also cant give up the idea of him because hes literally perfect for me. He has even told his friends before that he thinks im the perfect armenian girl for him. when we see each other it is so clearly tense and he slips up by showing more emotion than he wants/allows himself to, and of course i am an emotional hopeless romantic who is ready to jump on this opportunity. But all my friends tell me the perfect guy for me wouldnt make me sit and wait. they tell me: Dont wait and hope for a guy to chase you if he already knows exactly where to find you and hasnt come to you yet. ughhhh he drives me crazy\n"

I think we need to make it slightly longer. i unfortunately am someone whos thought about and dreamed my wedding day and being in love since i was very young. im very independent and honestly have never sat around wanting a boyfriend, but when it comes to finding the perfect person, i take it seriously. this boy is the one that checks the boxes, and how perfect that he feels the same way about me. i mean if he tells all his male friends and they feel the need to tell me, what does that say, you know? So yeah just a little longer and with a melody\n"

The verses use a descending melody pattern, while the chorus has a more rhythmic, emphatic delivery on \"drives me crazy.\" The bridge should be delivered with vulnerability before building back to the final powerful chorus.\n",

    "### My Commentary\n",
    "I honestly think that Claude did a pretty good job at this task. After explaining my dramatized situation to the LLM, it was able to produce a pretty emotional/heartfelt song that could not, at least in my opinion, be pointed out for being created by an LLM. However, I noticed that when it came to the visual representations, Claude only produces SVG files that aren't nearly as detailed, artistic, or enhanced as ChatGPT4o's images. The SVG graphics, while functional, lack the richness and complexity that more advanced image generation models can create. Yet, it doesn't completely take away from the song produced. The lyrics captured the raw emotion and specific nuances of my situation in a way that felt authentic and relatable, showing that AI can understand and articulate complex human feelings effectively."
