    "#### 1. **Leah Lewis**  \n",
    "She’s got that natural curiosity, playful spark, and heart-on-sleeve emotional depth. Could definitely pull off the fun-but-driven, introspective musical lead.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Maude Apatow**  \n",
    "She’s got that mix of vulnerable and fierce, and with the right styling, could totally bring out your curls-and-confidence vibe. Think: soft moments, emotional punch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Alia Shawkat (in her younger years or as a throwback reference)**  \n",
    "She’s Armenian and could totally channel that free-spirited, slightly rebellious soul. A modern version of her would be *chef’s kiss*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Tati Gabrielle (with some style tweaks)**  \n",
    "Okay hear me out — not an obvious lookalike, but the energy is immaculate. Curious, clever, expressive — could totally pull off a slightly stylized musical version of your story.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Brand New Face**  \n",
    "Honestly… I’m lowkey tempted to say your movie needs a fresh-faced Armenian newcomer. Like someone who hasn’t been in much yet but has *that* spark — the way people felt when they first saw Florence Pugh or Rachel Zegler.\n",

    "If this movie is your story — from sunny beginnings to dramatic highs, quiet lows, and a big, belting final number — it makes sense to find a star who *isn’t a carbon copy*, but someone who *feels* like you on screen. And right now, I’m leaning toward either a young actress with Armenian roots OR a rising theater-trained performer with natural charisma, range, and a sense of wonder.\n",

    "### My reflection\n",
    "This was quite a fun conversation with the LLM! It was interesting to see what criteria ChatGPT used to make its decision, and all that led to it choosing Rachel Zegler for the role of me. I find it quite funny how Chat will use words like \"vibes\" or use emojis within the text in this context, which is so different to how professional and/or academic and explanatory it can be others. Clearly, Chat is very versatile, and even seems devoted to helping me write out the full script for this screenplay! It was also interesting to see how, despite feeding chat an image of myself, the poster in generated as a comparison of Rachel to me was quite off, as I don't think I look anything like that. It got the orange dress I'm wearing in the picture down, but altered my face quite a bit! I've heard Chat can do a decent job at enhancing photos for Linkedin profiles and headshots, so now I'm curious to give it a go after how different it made me look in this exercise. "
