    "*If you're anything like me, you know how frustrating it can be to take the time to look nice for a school or work picture, just to open it up weeks later and not love it! While I thought this picture day problem would end after high school, it definitely has carried over into college. Each year, when my branch of the student newspaper on campus takes headshots, I never am happy with the way they turn out, and find myself not having one professional or academic-looking picture that I can use universally across applications, publications, professional social media pages, and more. So, it's time to turn to Ai for some help.* \n",

    "This conversation did not go as expected. I really thought ChatGPT4o would be able to produce a professional headshot of me, or at least a solid enhancement of the image I fed it, but it showed the same weaknesses as it did in the casting prompt. When it comes to producing images, it is clear the LLM has been programmed not to imitate exactly, and instead make new images that only slightly scratch the surface of the original image. I will say however that the ending was particularly intriguing, as it felt like I was receiving an apology from a partner or significant other after making a hurtful mistake in a relationship. The ending message was eerily similar to a breakup or apology! "
