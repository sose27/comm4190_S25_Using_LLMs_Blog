    "### First up: What is a Confidence Interval (CI)?\n",
    "At its core, a confidence interval gives you a **range of values** that likely includes the **true population parameter** (like the mean or proportion). We usually say weâ€™re \"95% confident\" that the true value lies within this interval.\n",

    "### Example:\n",
    "Letâ€™s say you survey a bunch of Penn students about how many hours they sleep per night, and you get a **sample mean** of 6.8 hours with a standard deviation of 1.2. If your sample size is 50 students, a 95% CI would give you a range (like 6.5 to 7.1 hours) where the *true* average sleep for all Penn students likely falls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Formula for a Confidence Interval (for a mean) is:\n",
    "\\[\n",
