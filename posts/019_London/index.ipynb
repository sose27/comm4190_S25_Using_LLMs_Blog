I take into consideration every neighborhood, sight, park, restaurant, and place I want to see and really make the effort to coordinate a schedule that allows me to see everything. Last semester I studied abroad in London, England, and made multiple weekend itineraries every time I had a visitor. Knowing what I know now, I want to see if chatGPT can do better than me!* \n",

    "### My reflection\n",
    "I was very pleasantly surprised with this one! I think the LLM did a stellar job with the itinerary. Maybe I am biased because I was a huge Gail's fan all semester, but I am so glad it was included! It hit many hotspots and areas in London I would include in an itinerary of my own. Of course there are a few more things I would've included that are more specific to me and things I LOVED during my time in London (King's Road, Pavillion Road, Shoreditch, the Boltons, St. Yeghiche Armenian Church, Elizabeth Street, etc.) but for a general itinerary, it really fit in everything I asked for and more! I will definitely use ChatGPT's help when planning future trips! "
