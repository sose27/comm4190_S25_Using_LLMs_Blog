    "I was pretty disappointed with this conversation with the LLM. Based on how capable it's proven itself to be with being a substitute for a friend (with advice, entertainment recommendations, homework help, and more) I really thought it would do a better job with this task. All the ideas and specific dresses it provided me were not real, existing items and were rather just generated dresses from its own creation. However, I did appreciate the details in the images, especially the fact that it included all the shoes I mentioned I own in different colors."
