    "\n",
    "*The Armenian language, which dates back to the early 5th century, is on the brink of endangerment. With the majority of Armenians living outside their homeland, the language is quickly getting swept up and overpowered by the main language of whatever country Armenians today find themselves in. What's more, the presence of two major dialects and hundreds of regional differences within each of these dialects makes keeping the Armenian language alive all the more difficult. Can AI be the tool the Armenian people need to preserve the language and teach the generations to come?* \n",

    "### My commentary\n",
    "\n",
    "I have very mixed emotions after this conversation with the LLM. At first, I was very impressed by the way it generated the Armenian alphabet in a chart with the letters' sounds, names, etc. It provided the history of the founding of the alphabet and seemed well-versed too. I was caught off guard and pleasantly surprised when it offered to teach me the alphabet through a song. As a native Armenian speaker, I am very knowledgeable of the standard alphabet song children are played when they're learning the alphabet. I found it interesting that Chat said the alphabet song would be in the same tune as twinkle twinkle little star - this is the case for the ABCs, not the ‘±‘≤‘≥... Either way I carried on, being impressed at the fact that it offered to actually produce a file with the song on it. It even offered different styles/voice options for the song. However, after days of going back and forth, it never fully provided a recording of the song. It kept offering me a \"silent placeholder file\" with no actual content to it. So this ended up being a let-down. I appreciated the enthusiasm, though. Also, I've noticed a pattern in ChatGPT's poor ability to generate accurate images. When I asked it to generate an image of the Armenian alphabet (the ‘±’µ’¢’∏÷Ç’¢’•’∂ / Aypoupen) it didn't consult the correct letters it initially offered me and instead made an image that mixed Armenian, English, and Russian characters. This I found quite strange and even after telling it what it did wrong and asking for it to correct itself, the images were never fully accurate."
