<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prompt">Prompt</h4>
<p>This is my job description for the summer:</p>
<p>About the position The Corporate Affairs &amp; Communications Strategy Intern will support PayPal’s Global Creative Strategy &amp; Production team by developing innovative strategies and content campaigns that enhance PayPal’s brand engagement. This role focuses on uncovering insights and creating cohesive strategies that elevate brand reputation and trust among key audiences. Responsibilities * Uncover fresh and innovative insights, story angles, narratives, brand direction and creative ideas to help fuel editorial and creative campaign strategy. * Distill insights into a cohesive and inspiring strategy and creative brief, ensuring the work remains on strategy throughout the process and connects to how success is measured. * Build creative strategies and plans that result in increased brand reputation and brand trust for PayPal among SMBs and consumers. * Deliver clear and concise point of view, supported by data, for how to solve business challenges and ensure PayPal’s brand narrative remains top of mind for our customers. * Assessment of existing tools and processes to innovate and improve PayPal’s approach. * Partner with agency teams on ongoing trendspotting/research to develop an editorial content strategy and work with global editorial team to ensure strategy comes to life across external channels. * Partner with agency teams and leverage third-party tools to build a content intelligence and measurement framework to illustrate the business impact of our brand content. * Set up clear performance measurement before campaigns or content launches and gain alignment across cross-functional teams. * Oversee Performance Comms program and ensure learnings from campaigns inform future strategy development. * Review monthly/quarterly measurement reports for key brand channels and distill insights and data points, so they can be socialized with internal teams. * Stay up to date on the latest tools and platforms that could help inform creative strategies. * Collaborate with cross-functional teams, such as Strategic Finance, Marketing Ops and Social Media teams, to uncover internal data points and insights that can be fed into planning. * Support the Global Head of Content Creation and Innovation and the Global Director of Content with team planning and strategy development. Requirements * Experience in communications, marketing and/or advertising, with increasing responsibilities. * Bachelor’s degree required and graduate degree in marketing or related field preferred. * Advertising, digital, PR and/or social media agency experience is a plus. * Larger focus on the creative side of strategy, versus the analytical side. * Ability to synthesize large amounts of data and communicate key points clearly, succinctly and quickly to change direction, stop or start campaigns as needed. * Ability to achieve results in a fast-paced and dynamic environment, often on short deadlines. * Strong at leading brainstorms and ability to take a large idea and build it into a cohesive and clear plan that internal teams and agency partners can execute against. * Superb communication skills, including writing, verbal and editing. * Amazing with PowerPoint and able to use it to sell in an idea or outline a clean plan. * Strong project management skill set, very organized, attention to detail. * Problem solver and self-starter that is focused on delivering results. * Sense of curiosity and eagerness to innovate and improve upon what’s already been done. * Passion for PayPal’s brand, and commitment to our vision of democratizing financial services. Nice-to-haves * Experience in a fast-paced corporate environment. * Familiarity with digital marketing tools and analytics platforms. Benefits * Flexible work environment * Employee shares options * Health insurance * Life insurance * Dental insurance * Vision insurance #### Response That’s such an exciting role, Sose — it blends creative storytelling with strategic communications in a really high-impact way. You’ll be doing everything from uncovering narrative insights to building brand trust strategies, all while collaborating across teams and using data to back it up. Honestly, it sounds like a dream for someone with your background in communications, consumer psychology, and content creation.</p>
<p>Let me know if you want help with anything related to the role — from prepping presentations, crafting creative briefs, or even making sense of content analytics. I’ve got your back! #### Prompt To be honest, Im really nervous! I know it may seem like this job is right up my alley, but i feel like im not prepared at ALL. and my first day is less than a month away! i dont understand so many basics of a financial company like PayPal and don’t know how i wont make myself look like an idiot. I worked so hard to get this job and am the only intern hired for this position. i am so scared of screwing up. #### Response That feeling is <em>so</em> valid — and honestly, it’s a sign that you care and <em>want</em> to do well, which already puts you ahead of the game. But let’s take a breath for a sec: you <em>earned</em> this internship. Out of who-knows-how-many applicants, <em>they chose you</em>. Not by accident, not as a favor — because your skills, your perspective, and your potential stood out. And that’s powerful.</p>
<p>It also makes total sense to feel overwhelmed when stepping into a space that’s unfamiliar (especially one like fintech — it’s fast-moving and full of lingo). But here’s the thing: <strong>you’re not expected to know everything on Day 1</strong>. Internships, especially at companies like PayPal, are built to <em>teach</em> you — not to test if you’re already an expert.</p>
<p>Let’s break it down so you feel more confident going in. Here’s a little pre-internship prep plan you can start now — and I can help with any of these:</p>

<section id="get-comfortable-with-paypal-itself" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="get-comfortable-with-paypal-itself">🔍 1. <strong>Get Comfortable with PayPal Itself</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Read their <strong>latest press releases</strong> and blog posts.</li>
<li>Look at their <strong>LinkedIn and Instagram</strong> to get a feel for how they talk about themselves and their brand voice.</li>
<li>Browse PayPal’s newsroom: https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/</li>
</ul>
<p>Want a cheat sheet on how PayPal works financially (e.g., how they make money, what SMBs are, what fintech even is)? I can build that for you.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learn-just-enough-about-the-fintech-space">🧠 2. <strong>Learn Just Enough About the Fintech Space</strong></h3>
<p>You <em>don’t</em> need to become an economist overnight. But getting a grasp on a few concepts will help: - What is <strong>fintech</strong>? - What are <strong>SMBs</strong> (small and midsize businesses) and how do they use PayPal? - What does <strong>brand trust</strong> mean in this space?</p>
<p>Again, I can walk you through these in plain English — no jargon.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sharpen-the-skills-you-already-have">💡 3. <strong>Sharpen the Skills You Already Have</strong></h3>
<p>Creative briefs? Insight mining? Campaign planning? You already <em>do</em> this — from your PC3I work to Sos Jewels. What’s different is the <strong>context</strong>, not the skill. So we’ll just reframe what you already know for this new world.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="remind-yourself-you-bring-what-no-one-else-can">✨ 4. <strong>Remind Yourself: You Bring What No One Else Can</strong></h3>
<p>You weren’t hired to be a finance expert. You were hired for your eye for story, your communications sharpness, your ability to connect ideas and people. That’s your edge. That’s your value. And that’s what they saw in you.</p>
<hr>
<p>Would it help if I made a “PayPal + fintech for beginners” guide tailored to your role, plus some “first week talking points” you can keep in your back pocket? Or a few self-assurance affirmations to keep close when impostor syndrome creeps in?</p>
<p>You’re going to be incredible. Let’s prep together. #### Prompt That all sounds great, thank you #### Response You got it 🫶 I’m really proud of you for being so open about your nerves — that’s honestly such a strength.</p>
<p>Let’s get started with a few helpful pieces, and you can tell me what else you’d want to go deeper on:</p>

<section id="part-1-wtf-is-fintech-a-crash-course" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-1-wtf-is-fintech-a-crash-course">🧾 <strong>Part 1: “WTF is Fintech?” — A Crash Course</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Fintech</strong> = Financial Technology<br>
Any technology that improves or automates the delivery of financial services — like online payments, budgeting apps, trading platforms, or digital wallets.</p>
<section id="examples-of-fintech-in-action" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="examples-of-fintech-in-action">Examples of Fintech in Action:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>PayPal</strong>: Lets you send and receive money, pay merchants, and store funds without needing a traditional bank.</li>
<li><strong>Venmo</strong>: A PayPal company focused on peer-to-peer payments, especially for younger users.</li>
<li><strong>Stripe / Square</strong>: Compete with PayPal to provide online payment infrastructure to small businesses.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="why-it-matters" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters:</h4>
<p>Fintech is about <strong>making money easier, faster, and more accessible</strong> — especially for groups who have been left out by traditional banking systems. That’s why PayPal talks a lot about <strong>“democratizing financial services.”</strong></p>
<hr>
</section>
</section>
<section id="part-2-how-does-paypal-make-money" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-2-how-does-paypal-make-money">🏦 <strong>Part 2: How Does PayPal Make Money?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transaction Fees</strong>: Merchants using PayPal pay a small fee per sale (like 2.9% + 30¢).</li>
<li><strong>PayPal Credit &amp; BNPL</strong>: They offer “buy now, pay later” and credit options, earning from interest and partner fees.</li>
<li><strong>Value-Added Services</strong>: Like fraud protection, invoicing tools, seller insights, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>So your role supports this indirectly by helping <strong>build trust and loyalty</strong> around the brand, so people <em>want</em> to use PayPal instead of a competitor.</p>

<p><strong>SMBs = Small and Midsize Businesses</strong><br>
Think Etsy shop owners, freelance graphic designers, boutique retailers, etc.</p>
<p>They use PayPal to: - Accept payments easily - Track finances - Offer flexible payment plans - Operate globally without needing a full-scale finance department</p>
<p>Helping SMBs trust and love PayPal is <strong>key to their growth strategy.</strong> You’ll help tell the story of <em>why PayPal is their best friend</em>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mini-glossary-paypal-fintech-buzzwords">📘 <strong>Mini Glossary: PayPal &amp; Fintech Buzzwords</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1. Fintech</strong><br>
Short for <em>financial technology</em>. Refers to digital tools that make financial services easier, faster, and more accessible (like PayPal, Venmo, Robinhood, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>2. SMB (Small and Midsize Businesses)</strong><br>
Businesses that aren’t huge corporations. Think of Etsy sellers, coffee shop owners, fitness coaches, or local bookstores. PayPal provides tools to help them grow and operate online.</p>
<p><strong>3. Brand Trust</strong><br>
How much people believe your company is reliable, ethical, and secure. A brand with trust feels honest, safe, and consistent — super important for a company handling people’s money.</p>
<p><strong>4. Brand Narrative</strong><br>
The overarching story PayPal tells about who they are and what they stand for. For example: “We believe in financial inclusion” or “We help small businesses grow.”</p>
<p><strong>5. Creative Brief</strong><br>
A short document that outlines the goals, target audience, tone, and direction of a campaign or project. Basically: the plan before the creative work begins.</p>
<p><strong>6. Insight Mining</strong><br>
Digging into data, trends, or behavior to figure out what people want or feel. These “insights” guide messaging and campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>7. Editorial Strategy</strong><br>
A game plan for what content to post/share (articles, videos, social, etc.), why it’s valuable, and how it fits into the brand narrative.</p>
<p><strong>8. Content Intelligence</strong><br>
Tools or analysis that measure how content performs. It helps teams know what’s working, what’s not, and what to do next.</p>
<p><strong>9. Measurement Framework</strong><br>
The system used to track whether a campaign is successful — often using KPIs (key performance indicators) like engagement, clicks, conversions, or brand sentiment.</p>
<p><strong>10. Cross-functional Teams</strong><br>
Groups made up of people from different departments (like Marketing, Finance, and Product) who collaborate on a shared project.</p>
<p><strong>11. Performance Comms</strong><br>
A communications strategy that focuses on <em>results</em> — not just posting content, but making sure it actually moves the needle (e.g.&nbsp;brand sentiment, media reach, revenue impact).</p>
<p><strong>12. Trendspotting</strong><br>
Finding and analyzing emerging trends in culture, consumer behavior, or media. Think: “What are Gen Z talking about this week and how can PayPal stay relevant?”</p>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="day-to-day-collaboration" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="day-to-day-collaboration">💬 Day-to-Day Collaboration</h3>
<ul>
<li>“How do creative ideas usually come to life here — is it more team brainstorms or individual proposals?”</li>
<li>“What’s the best way to share early ideas — quick chats, decks, or email?”</li>

<ul>
<li>“What are a few things I can do in the first two weeks that would be helpful to the team?”</li>
<li>“Is there anything past interns did that really stood out?”</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Let me know if you want me to turn this into a one-page doc you can screenshot or print — and if you ever want to roleplay Day 1 convos, mock up a creative brief, or brainstorm ideas to bring into meetings, I’m your intern buddy too 😌 #### Prompt reading the job description more closely, can you cover additional skills i need to work on before getting there? and how to improve them? #### Response Absolutely — let’s go through the job description with fresh eyes and pinpoint the key <strong>skills</strong> PayPal is expecting, then I’ll recommend how to brush up on each <strong>before Day 1</strong>. You already have a <em>lot</em> of the foundation — this is just about tightening things up and getting more comfortable.</p>

<p>“Set up clear performance measurement… Review monthly/quarterly reports…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What to work on:</strong> - Understanding engagement metrics (CTR, impressions, shares, etc.) - Knowing what success looks like in branded content - Talking about data confidently</p>
<p><strong>How to improve:</strong> - Read basic guides on content KPIs (HubSpot, Hootsuite, or Google Analytics tutorials). - Practice summarizing performance: &gt; “This post got 10% more engagement than usual — likely due to X trend and a clearer call to action.”</p>
<p>If you want, I can give you fake campaign data to practice analyzing and summarizing — great warm-up for real meetings.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Deliver clear and concise point of view, supported by data…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What to work on:</strong> - Building arguments: “Here’s the problem → Here’s what we should do → Here’s why it works.” - Using both creative instinct <em>and</em> data - Thinking proactively: “How can we improve X next time?”</p>
<p><strong>How to improve:</strong> - Practice “shark tank” style thinking: pitch a made-up idea, back it with logic or numbers. - Watch brand case studies (e.g., <em>WARC</em>, <em>Contagious</em>) to see how teams justify creative decisions. - Ask yourself: “If I had to explain this strategy to a non-marketing person, could I?”</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-reflection">My reflection</h3>
<p>This ended up being a wonderful use of an LLM! I honestly feel better about my real nerves around my internship, and will be using the boot camp plan created for me to prep! I found it really interesting and honestly funny that when attempting to make me feel better, Chat decided to draw from my “experience with content creation via Sos Jewels.” This is quite humorous since Sos Jewels was a brand I made up solely for another blog post! But that aside, the LLM did a great job in not only providing an action plan to help me put my best foot forward, but also by lifting my moods and appealing to my emotions, validating me like a human would with phrases like “Out of who-knows-how-many applicants, they chose you.” I am very very pleased with this conversation!</p>
