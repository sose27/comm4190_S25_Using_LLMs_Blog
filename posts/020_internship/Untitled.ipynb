Internships, especially at companies like PayPal, are built to *teach* you ‚Äî not to test if you‚Äôre already an expert.\n",

    "### üß† 2. **Learn Just Enough About the Fintech Space**\n",
    "You *don‚Äôt* need to become an economist overnight. But getting a grasp on a few concepts will help:\n",
    "- What is **fintech**?\n",
    "- What are **SMBs** (small and midsize businesses) and how do they use PayPal?\n",

    "Again, I can walk you through these in plain English ‚Äî no jargon.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ú® 4. **Remind Yourself: You Bring What No One Else Can**\n",
    "You weren‚Äôt hired to be a finance expert. You were hired for your eye for story, your communications sharpness, your ability to connect ideas and people. That‚Äôs your edge. That‚Äôs your value. And that‚Äôs what they saw in you.\n",

    "Any technology that improves or automates the delivery of financial services ‚Äî like online payments, budgeting apps, trading platforms, or digital wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of Fintech in Action:\n",
    "- **PayPal**: Lets you send and receive money, pay merchants, and store funds without needing a traditional bank.\n",
    "- **Venmo**: A PayPal company focused on peer-to-peer payments, especially for younger users.\n",
    "- **Stripe / Square**: Compete with PayPal to provide online payment infrastructure to small businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why It Matters:\n",
    "Fintech is about **making money easier, faster, and more accessible** ‚Äî especially for groups who have been left out by traditional banking systems. That's why PayPal talks a lot about **\"democratizing financial services.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üè¶ **Part 2: How Does PayPal Make Money?**\n",
    "- **Transaction Fees**: Merchants using PayPal pay a small fee per sale (like 2.9% + 30¬¢).\n",
    "- **PayPal Credit & BNPL**: They offer ‚Äúbuy now, pay later‚Äù and credit options, earning from interest and partner fees.\n",
    "- **Value-Added Services**: Like fraud protection, invoicing tools, seller insights, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So your role supports this indirectly by helping **build trust and loyalty** around the brand, so people *want* to use PayPal instead of a competitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üë• **Part 3: What Are SMBs and Why Do They Matter?**\n",
    "**SMBs = Small and Midsize Businesses**  \n",
    "Think Etsy shop owners, freelance graphic designers, boutique retailers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "They use PayPal to:\n",
    "- Accept payments easily\n",
    "- Track finances\n",
    "- Offer flexible payment plans\n",
    "- Operate globally without needing a full-scale finance department\n",
    "\n",
    "Helping SMBs trust and love PayPal is **key to their growth strategy.** You‚Äôll help tell the story of *why PayPal is their best friend*.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîë **Part 4: Buzzwords You Might Hear**\n",

    "This ended up being a wonderful use of an LLM! I honestly feel better about my real nerves around my internship, and will be using the boot camp plan created for me to prep! I found it really interesting and honestly funny that when attempting to make me feel better, Chat decided to draw from my \"experience with content creation via Sos Jewels.\" This is quite humorous since Sos Jewels was a brand I made up solely for another blog post! But that aside, the LLM did a great job in not only providing an action plan to help me put my best foot forward, but also by lifting my moods and appealing to my emotions, validating me like a human would with phrases like \"Out of who-knows-how-many applicants, they chose you.\" I am very very pleased with this conversation!"
