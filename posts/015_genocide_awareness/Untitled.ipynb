    "*I‚Äôm a descendant of Armenian Genocide survivors. My great-grandparents escaped the slaughtering arms of Turkish gendarmes and fled to America, giving my family a chance at survival. Now, it‚Äôs on me to make sure their stories are heard. 110 years after the Armenian Genocide of 1915, Turkey still denies it ever happened. And today, Turkey and Azerbaijan continue what they started‚Äîtrying to wipe out the Armenian people through ethnic cleansing, again, just in the last five years. I, along with Armenian students everywhere, call on our universities to speak up, to recognize this ongoing human rights crisis, and to help end this cycle of denial and violence.* \n",

    "Well you see, i am an undergraduate at the university of pennsylvania. i see how other schools like UCLA, USC, and even harvard have armenian studies programs and unequivocally support the recognition of the 1915 armenian genocide. i dont know how to make this change at penn. I have already started an armenian language course + am a member of the armenian students club that has a speaker event today for the 110th commemoration. what else can i do? the university needs to recognize this!

    "Sose, first of all‚Äîwhat you‚Äôre doing already is *powerful.* Teaching Western Armenian on campus, organizing speaker events, and building community through the Armenian Students Club‚Äîthose are acts of cultural preservation and resistance. Seriously, you are already carrying forward a legacy of strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you're right: **institutional recognition matters**, and Penn should be part of that growing academic and moral movement. Here are some steps you can take to push for change:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ü™ß 1. **Draft a Formal Petition or Resolution**\n",
    "- Partner with the Armenian Students Club and allies in other cultural orgs.\n",
    "- Frame it not just as a call for genocide recognition but also a demand for an **Armenian Studies Program**, modeled on what USC, UCLA, or Harvard offer.\n",
    "- Cite peer institutions and emphasize the academic value: genocide studies, diaspora studies, language preservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† 2. **Meet with Faculty Allies**\n",
    "- Reach out to professors in **history, Near Eastern languages and civilizations, political science, and human rights.**\n",
    "- Many faculty will support your efforts and could help advocate internally for curriculum change or event funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üì£ 3. **Organize a Public Awareness Campaign**\n",
    "- Use on-campus media (The Daily Pennsylvanian), flyers, and social media to inform the student body.\n",
    "- A photo installation or testimonial wall on Locust Walk around April 24 could make people *see* the loss and history.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üßæ 4. **Submit an Op-Ed or Statement**\n",
    "- A student-penned column (like yours!) in the DP or a broader outlet can make a big splash. You have the voice and the credibility‚Äîuse it to pressure Penn to make a statement of recognition and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ü§ù 5. **Form a Coalition**\n",
    "- Reach out to Jewish, Greek, and other student groups whose communities have endured oppression or genocide.\n",
    "- Cross-cultural solidarity gives your cause more weight and fosters mutual understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üíå 6. **Write to Administration**\n",
    "- A respectful, direct letter to the **Office of the President or Provost** can start a dialogue.\n",
    "- Emphasize the academic integrity, ethical responsibility, and peer precedent of recognizing the genocide and establishing a program.\n",

I write to you today not only as a member of the Armenian Students Association, but also as a representative of a broader community of students who believe in the values of truth, justice, and historical accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, April 24th, marks the 110th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide‚Äîthe systematic extermination of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire beginning in 1915. This day is recognized around the world as a solemn moment of remembrance, resistance, and education. Yet at Penn, a leading institution of global scholarship and civic engagement, there remains a noticeable silence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many peer institutions‚Äîincluding UCLA, USC, Harvard, and Columbia‚Äîhave taken clear steps to honor and recognize this history. They have publicly acknowledged the Armenian Genocide, supported programming for genocide education, and established Armenian Studies programs that promote cultural and historical scholarship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Penn has the opportunity‚Äîand the responsibility‚Äîto do the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of institutional support, our Armenian student community has worked hard to keep our heritage alive. This year, I launched an Armenian language course on campus. We have hosted cultural events, speaker panels, and commemorations. But these efforts need and deserve the backing of the university itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We respectfully ask the administration to:\n",
    "1. Publicly recognize the Armenian Genocide.\n",
    "2. Explore the establishment of an Armenian Studies initiative, potentially housed within the School of Arts & Sciences.\n",
    "3. Support student-led initiatives around genocide remembrance, cultural preservation, and historical education.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are not just Armenian issues‚Äîthey are human issues. At a time when truth is often under attack and historical revisionism is widespread, silence can be complicity. Penn has long prided itself on being a leader in ethical research, global education, and social progress. This is a chance to reaffirm that commitment.\n",
